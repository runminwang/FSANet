FSANet: Feature Shuffle and Adaptive Channel Attention Network for Arbitrary Shape Scene Text Detection
Natural scene text detection has made significant progress in deep learning eraHowever, existing methods still exhibit deficiencies in the face of challenges such as complex backgrounds, extreme aspect ratios, and arbitrary shape text. To address these issues, we propose a segmentation-based Feature Shuffle Attention Network (FSANet) designed to enhance high-resolution feature extraction and multi-scale feature enhancement for robust arbitrary shape text detection. FSANet is composed of two principal modules: (1) the High-Resolution Feature Extraction Network (FEN), which employs a novel Group Shuffle Block (GSB) to maintain high-resolution details and promote feature interaction and information flow; and (2) the Adaptive Channel Attention Module (ACAM), which mitigates background noise and redundant features by adaptively learning inter-feature correlations across scales, assigning weights to prioritize local features within a global context. Extensive experiments conducted on several public benchmark datasets demonstrate that FSANet surpasses the majority of state-of-the-art methods.
